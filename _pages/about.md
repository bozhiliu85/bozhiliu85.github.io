6 years work experience in conducting research in AI based image processing technology and applications in university. Aspires to obtain a programmer, technician or an engineer position. 

I am a deep learning researcher with a focus on Machine learning based high dynamic range imaging technology and its applications. My goal is to create more realistic and controllable generated images through the use of these techniques. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham in 2018, and my master’s from Nottingham as well in 2010, and bachelor’s degrees from Nanjing University of Science and Technology (Nanjing) in 2008, respectively. I was born in the beautiful city of Tianjin, China.

Programming
======
My programming journey began in 2004 with C++, which fostered my programming thinking and skills. Throughout my PhD, I primarily used Matlab for scientific programming, and as the era of deep learning emerged, I transitioned to predominantly using Python. Additionally, I have experience with Java, SQL, QT, and Perl due to my participation in various relevant projects. My role as the administrator of our group website in Shenzhen made me familiar with web programming languages such as PHP and HTML. As an IT Technician responsible for servers in our group, I am well-versed in working with Linux systems, servers, and open-source code repositories. I believe my programming background positions me well to fulfill the job requirements.

research coordinator
======
Another role I have taken on is that of a research coordinator. Our lab was founded in 2017 with just two people, my PhD supervisor and me. Over the past five years, I have coordinated with other departments in our university, including finance, human resources, equipment division, and so on. I have also been responsible for facilitating cross-lab collaborations with other research groups, both nationally and internationally, including appling fundings jointly. I have prepared over 10 fund proposals from city to national levels. By the end of my contract, our lab had grown to include more than 50 members, granted over 10 million krona in funding, and built a computing cluster with 12 4-GPU servers. I believe my interdisciplinary background has allowed me to collaborate effectively with others and successfully address researchers' needs by providing technical solutions.

Recent Project
------
A major challenge for high dynamic range (HDR) image reconstruction from multi-exposed low dynamic range (LDR) images, especially with dynamic scenes, is the extraction and merging of relevant contextual features in order to suppress any ghosting and blurring artifacts from moving objects. To tackle this, in this work we propose a novel
network for HDR reconstruction with deep and rich feature extraction layers, including residual attention blocks with sequential channel and spatial attention. For the compression of the rich-features to the HDR domain, a residual feature distillation block (RFDB) based architecture is adopted. In contrast to earlier deep-learning methods for HDR, the above contributions shift focus from merging/compression to feature extraction, the added value of which we demonstrate with ablation experiments. We present qualitative and quantitative comparisons on public benchmark datasets, showing that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
