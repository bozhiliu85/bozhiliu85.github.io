Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Bozhi Liu, a researcher with a focus on Machine learning based high dynamic range imaging technology and its applications. My goal is to create more realistic and controllable generated images through the use of these techniques. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham in 2018, and my master’s from Nottingham as well in 2010, and bachelor’s degrees from Nanjing University of Science and Technology (Nanjing) in 2008, respectively. I was born in the beautiful city of Tianjin, China.

About Me
======
I am currently a Visiting Researcher at the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University, where I have been exploring high dynamic range imaging technology. My academic journey has equipped me with in-depth knowledge of advanced techniques in image reconstruction, deep learning frameworks, and data analysis.

Professional Experience
======
I have had the privilege of working as an Associate Researcher at Shenzhen University in China for over six years. During my time there, I focused on research related to high-quality image and video processing, utilizing cutting-edge AI and ML algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. My proficiency extends to programming languages such as C++, Python, Matlab, and more.

Project Coordination & Administration
======
As a Project Coordinator at Vista Lab, Shenzhen University, I played a pivotal role in expanding the lab's capabilities and securing substantial funding. I have experience in coordinating various departments, managing budgets, overseeing research communication, and even administering websites and servers. My ability to bridge technical and non-technical aspects has been crucial in my role.
