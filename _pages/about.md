Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Bozhi Liu, a researcher with a focus on machine learning based high dynamic range imaging technology and its applications. My goal is to create more realistic and controllable HDR images and videos through the use of these techniques. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham in 2018, and my master’s from Nottingham as well in 2010, and bachelor’s degrees from Nanjing University of Science and Technology (Nanjing) in 2008, respectively. I was born in the beautiful city of Tianjin, China.

About Me
======
Associate Researcher: I've spent the past six years honing my skills in both research and administration at Shenzhen University. My work encompassed a wide range of topics, from high dynamic range image and video enhancement to image quality assessment and super resolution. I've also been deeply involved in cross-lab collaborations, securing funding, and coordinating with various departments, making sure that the gears of our research machinery ran smoothly.

Visiting Researcher at Uppsala University: My current role as a Visiting Researcher at Uppsala University has provided me with a unique opportunity to delve into the world of deep learning technology applied to high dynamic image processing. I've had the privilege of working with Prof. Orcun Goksel at the Department of Information Technology, exploring new horizons in this exciting field.
